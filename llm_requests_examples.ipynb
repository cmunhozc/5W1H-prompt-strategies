Despite driving at his brilliant best to win the Brazilian Grand Prix for the first time in his career, his title looks destined to be crossing the Mercedes garage floor to Nico Rosberg. Getty Images 6 Lewis Hamilton celebrates victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix Getty Images 6 But the World Championship is likely to be Nico Rosberg\\'s in Abu Dhabi Getty Images 6 Romain Grosjean\\'s car was towed after crashing out in the formation lap of a chaotic race Hamilton, reigned supreme in the rain-hit incident packed race that saw TWO red flags and FIVE safety cars deployed. It was the 52nd victory of his F1 career and moves him to second in the all-time winners\\' list behind Michael Schumacher. But the looming figure of Rosberg stood next to him on the podium in second place means the German can win the title with a top-three finish in Abu Dhabi, irrespective of where Hamilton finishes. Hamilton\\'s third win in a row cannot stop the tide. The damage was done early in the season with woeful reliability problems ensuring that it goes down to the final race. Nevertheless, the Brit has promised to give it his best shot in the desert. He said: \"I am hunting and all I can do is do what I can. I am going to give it my all in Abu Dhabi. \"I need to keep on doing. It is going to be hard to beat Nico but it does not mean I cannot win the race. \"I am going to take this energy and speed and try to push as hard as I can to win that race.\" Getty Images 6 Hamilton was left furious after the race was twice red flagged Rosberg was given a huge helping hand thanks to a Red Bull strategy blunder to pit the swashbuckling Max Verstappen for intermediate tyres. The sensational Dutch driver made a string of sensational overtakes that livened up this race but after overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and Rosberg, was inexplicably called in for fresh rubber. The gambled backfired and a subsequent stop dropped him down to 15th place -- incredibly he battled back to third. Hamilton was also left furious after race bosses put the brakes on his charge to the chequered flag on two occasions. At one point, the Brit had a stonking lead that was almost 26 second over his rival but that was wiped out when the retiring Felipe Massa crashed out, forcing out the safety car. Getty Images 6 Red Bull\\'s Max Verstappen was the outstanding driver at Interlagos Then there was Race Director Charlie Whiting\\'s inexplicable call to stop the race, despite a number of drivers, including Hamilton, calling for him to allow them to race. Hamilton vented his frustration over the team\\'s radio towards Whiting -- who was blasted by Ferrari\\'s Sebastian Vettel in the last race. At the second red flag, Hamilton groaned: \"The track is fine! It is not even that wet now. This is not extreme wet conditions this is normal.\" The spectators at Interlagos also greeted Whiting\\'s decision with jeers. As it happened, Whiting\\'s decision made no difference to Hamilton, thought it could have forced Rosberg into making a mistake that would have put him out of the race. No wonder then that the German was content with second place that leaves him with a 12 point lead in the championship with one to go. Lewis Hamilton talks about how good the team at Mercedes are He added: \"It did not go my way. Lewis did a great job but I can live with second. I was hoping for a win for second is OK.\" Hamilton\\'s win was good but the real star was Verstappen. The 19-year-old was belittled by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff last week after he contacted his father, Jos, to warn him about his son meddling in the title race. Yet he answered the criticism perfectly with a thrilling performance, including one of the saves of the season, impressing Verstappen senior in the process. Jos Verstappen said: \"I must say he surprised me today. I\\'ve seen many races he did, and today it was incredible. \"He did himself a big pleasure today. They didn\\'t have the right strategy, unlucky with weather, but it was good for Formula One.\" AP:Associated Press 6 Massa gave the home crowd an emotional farewell in his last ever Brazilian Grand Prix DRIVER OF THE DAY: Max Verstappen stole the show with an amazing drive. MOVE OF THR RACE: Verstappen pulled off a blinder on Kimi Raikkonen at turn one on lap eight. MILKFLOAT: Jenson Button had a miserable afternoon in his McLaren. MISTAKE OF THE RACE: Romain Grosjean never even made it to the grid after crashing out on the formation lap. TIMELINE Lap 14 Marcus Ericsson has a big smash in his Sauber and the safety car is deployed Lap 20 Kimi Raikkonen has a huge smash and the race is red flagged. Lap 29 Drivers are left furious as Charlie Whiting stops the race with another red flag. Lap 44 Verstappen is called in for intermediate tyres -- a costly decision from Red Bull. Lap 48 Felipe Massa has a smash and the safety car is deployed. It wipes out Hamilton\\'s lead. Lap 69 Verstappen passes Sergio Perez to take an impressive third place.',\n",

        "                  \"News Body: There is no doubting the significance of Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby now. Debate has raged in Newcastle as to which their fans would rather see - a place in the Capital One Cup semi-final or a first win over Sunderland in six attempts. The majority sided with the former and a shot at a first domestic trophy since 1955. That dream, however, is dead. Alan Pardew and his players had talked of a ‘massive’ week in their season. Well, it just got bigger. Massadio Haidara consoles keeper Jak Alnwick after a night to forget for Newcastle at Tottenham. Newcastle’s defence reels as Spurs celebrate the final goal of their 4-0 defeat of the Toon on Wednesday. For Alan Pardew’s side, Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby takes on a new dimension now they’re out of the cup. The manager had, in fairness, named just about the strongest XI available to him but it looked awfully weak against a Spurs side who were superior in every department. The against-the-odds spirit that had inspired Newcastle’s 2-0 victory at Manchester City in the last round was missing. It was, in the end, a rather timid surrender. Apart from Moussa Sissoko, the French battering ram who tried his best to barge his team forward, the visitors offered little. Sissoko’s compatriots Yoan Gouffran, Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere – a combined 20 million worth of ‘ talent ’ – were passengers on a journey destined to end in defeat from the moment Jak Alnwick spilled Christian Eriksen’s corner and Nabil Bentaleb looped home the opening goal. A Newcastle fan, one of 4,200 supporters to travel down to London, gives his appraisal of the match. These shirtless lads do their best to lift their team having made the journey for the Capital One Cup loss. This has been a Newcastle team characterised by resistance and resilience, neither of which was in evidence. It was their second heavy loss in north London in five days and such drubbings will do little for the team’s confidence come Sunday. Pardew is the only manager in Newcastle’s history to lose three in a row against their North-East rivals and, with the mitigation of a cup run gone, he can ill afford another defeat this weekend. It was after Spurs ’ fourth goal – Roberto Soldado capitalising on another Alnwick spill – that Pardew turned his attention to the derby. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet issues instructions to his players on their way to a 1-1 draw with West Ham. Jordi Gomez celebrates putting Sunderland 1-0 up from the penalty spot at home against West Ham. The thought of going into that game without Sissoko is a frightening one and, when he took what proved to be an innocuous knock to the knee, Pardew withdrew his star man almost immediately. His effort was recognised by the 4,200 travelling fans and they sang until the last kick of an otherwise torrid evening. Pardew acknowledged their support but will be in doubt about how fast such goodwill would evaporate should they fail to show against Gus Poyet’s side. The debate on radio phone-ins and in the local newspaper had been ‘which of the two matches would you prefer to win? ’ Losing both was never an option. Pardew, of course, has done tremendously well to transform his own and Newcastle’s fortunes, but the mood can change quickly on Tyneside. After this humiliation, Pardew will be only too aware of Sunday’s significance.\\n\"\n",

        "Meanwhile, a suit worn by Daniel Craig in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall sold for $35,000 (£27,000).\n",

        "But the company said the website would remain available to users in Brazil.\n",
        "While X argued that it was protecting free speech and standing up against \"illegal secret censorship,\" Brazil's Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes argued he was standing up against disinformation and tyranny in Brazil.\n",
        "In April, Moraes had ordered an investigation into Musk, accusing him of \"criminal instrumentalization\" of the platform. An order seen by AFP detailed that Musk had reactivated banned accounts and was then threatened with a fine for each instance.\n",
        "This comes roughly a week after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro banned the website for a 10-day period over an election result dispute and accused Musk of inciting hate, civil war, and death.\n",
        "Musk has been increasingly outspoken on Latin American politics, as he has on politics in general, of late.\n",
        "What did X say?\n",
        "\"Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions,\" X's Global Government Affairs department said in a post on Saturday.\n",
        "\"We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision. The responsibility lies solely with Alexandre de Moraes,\" the post read. \"His actions are incompatible with democratic government. The people of Brazil have a choice to make — democracy, or Alexandre de Moraes.\"\n",
        "The post said X's numerous appeals went unheard at the court while the public was not informed of the orders. The Brazilian office's staff had \"no responsibility or control\" over whether content was blocked from the platform.\n",
        "The decision to close down local operations was taken to protect the safety of the staff, it said.\n",
        "Billionaire Musk, in his post, said the decision was \"difficult, but, if we had agreed to Alexandre's (illegal) secret censorship and private information handover demands, there was no way we could explain our actions without being ashamed.\"\n",
        "What did Moraes say?\n",
        "Moraes has previously ordered several social media accounts Brazil's authorities suspected of spreading disinformation, including those of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro who tried discrediting the nation's voting system after he lost the 2022 election.\n",
        "\"Freedom of expression doesn't mean freedom of aggression,\" Moraes has said. \"It doesn't mean the freedom to defend tyranny.\"\n",
